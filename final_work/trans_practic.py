Think of Hugging Face as a toolbox:

Transformers → Tools (models) 🛠️

Datasets → Materials (data) 📚

Hugging Face Hub (website) → Marketplace where tools & materials are shared 🌍 


1. 🤖 Models

Pre-trained AI models shared by the community.

Example: Sentiment analysis, Question answering, Translation, Chatbots, Summarization.

You don’t need to train from scratch → just load and use.

2. 📚 Datasets

Ready-to-use datasets for NLP, vision, audio, etc.

Example: IMDB (movie reviews), SQuAD (Q&A), Common Voice (speech).

Helps you train or test your own models.
